Welcome to the second project in my **Docs‑as‑Code Portfolio Series**, where I’m building and publishing documentation sites using four different static site generators (SSGs): **MkDocs**, **Hugo**, **Docusaurus**, and **Jekyll**.

This site represents my work with **Docusaurus** and demonstrates how I approach modern documentation workflows—from information architecture and content strategy to build automation and publishing.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Project

As a Sr. Technical Writer, I use git‑based workflows and developer‑centric tooling.  
This portfolio series is my opportunity to:

- Strengthen and demonstrate my docs‑as‑code skills  
- Explore and compare popular SSGs used in engineering teams  
- Showcase real examples of my technical writing  
- Build documentation sites end‑to‑end using best practices  
- Create a curated, public‑facing writing and tooling portfolio

:::tip
This page is the **documentation homepage** in Docusaurus. Because it’s `docs/index.md`, it’s automatically served at **`/docs/`**.  
(If you ever switch to docs‑only mode with `routeBasePath: '/'`, we can set `slug: "/"` here.)

## ⚙️ What I Built Using **Docusaurus**

### 🔧 Full Docs‑as‑Code Workflow
- Authored content in Markdown/MDX  
- Version control with Git  
- Autogenerated sidebars (via `_category_.json` for labels/order)  
- Light‑only theme to match my portfolio preference

### 🚀 Automated Build & Publish
- Local dev (`npm start`) and production build (`npm run build`)  
- Deployable to GitHub Pages, Vercel, or Netlify

### 📚 Organized Documentation Examples
- **User Guides** → ./user-guides/  
- **API Guides** → ./api-guides/  
- **How‑To Articles** → ./how-to-articles/  
- **Technical Reference Guides** → ./technical-reference-guides/

## 🚧 What’s Next: 4‑SSG Series Roadmap

1. **MkDocs** — ✔️ Completed  
2. **Hugo** — Work in progress  
3. **Docusaurus** — ✔️ This site  
4. **Jekyll** — Final project

At the end of the series, I’ll publish a comparative write‑up covering setup, customization, plugin ecosystems, docs‑as‑code workflows, and best use cases.
